Features
1. **Navigation Bar:**
Positioned at the top of the page using position: fixed
Horizontally centered with justify-content: center (Flexbox property).

challenges i faced was flexbox position,spacing and how it is placed.

another challenge faced was nav bar it was not on top and was not sticking on top so had to use top:0 in css styling for the nav to stick on top.
